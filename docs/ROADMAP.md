# Roadmap & History

The comprehensive delivery program, capability ledger, hard gates, and adversarial review
protocol are in [`END-GOAL-PLAN.md`](END-GOAL-PLAN.md). This file remains the short history.

> Where Syzygy came from, what's done, and what's next — so decisions don't get re-made.

## Lineage

1. Existing collaborative research tools demonstrated a valuable workflow, but commonly
   rely on paid editor/collaboration services, hosted databases, and large-model APIs.
   They are product comparisons only—not source material for Syzygy.
2. **syzygy-web** (`D:\PolicyPad\syzygy-web`) was an early experiment and is abandoned.
   None of its code, prompts, schemas, fixtures, assets, templates, or UI may be ported.
3. **Syzygy** (this repo) — pivot to desktop: fork of **Aphelion**'s proven Tauri shell
   (installer, auto-updater, bundled llama.cpp engine, Rust file access), roleplay
   surface removed, document/collab surface being built.

## Done (shipped)

- **v0.1.0** — Aphelion shell stripped to the Ask surface (experts, folder knowledge,
  document generation, optional vision). Real dead-code removal; store/types rewritten;
  persist key `syzygy`.
- **v0.1.1** — Google Drive auth (loopback + PKCE, cancelable, scope fail-fast + helper
  modal); Drive file primitives + per-thread prompt mirroring; **paper/ink design
  system** (default theme, IBM Plex, aligned-bodies mark, animated splash); diagnostic
  log + Settings viewer; renameable/scrolling ask threads; reopenable model wizard;
  **live update pipeline** (signed releases, in-app updater, 3-OS CI).
- **v0.1.2** — **Drive folder mirror** (`Documents/Syzygy` ↔ Drive, two-way LWW sync);
  📂 Use Drive folder (knowledge reads + documents land there, auto-push after
  generation); offline-claims copy audit → local-first voice.

## Next (in intended order)

Shared-folder Ask now uses remote-first Drive retrieval, including native Google
Docs/Sheets/Slides export. The local mirror remains available through explicit Sync so
collaborators are not required to download large project folders.

1. **Prove the two-machine loop** — same Google account or a shared folder on two
   installs: document generated on A appears on B after sync; knowledge dropped on B
   answers questions on A. This validates the transport before any CRDT work.
2. **Build the Penumbra collaborative editor independently**:
   - Start with exact-version MIT Lexical and Yjs packages after the provenance gate in
     `END-GOAL-PLAN.md`; author every node, plugin, command, schema, test, and UI here.
   - Keep domain and provider interfaces independent from editor, Drive, and AI vendors.
   - Design target: the "research editor" panel of the approved mockup (version rail,
     evaluation panel, mono metadata stamps).
3. **Real collaboration on the folder** — Yjs doc persisted in the synced folder;
   merge-on-sync instead of last-write-wins; presence later. Drive is transport #1;
   self-hosted y-websocket-compatible and P2P transports are siblings behind the same abstraction.
4. **Independent research workflows on top** — scenarios, structured policy blocks,
   heuristics, evaluation, versions, and review, designed and prompted from scratch for
   Syzygy's local model.

## Backlog (unordered)

- Sync watcher/interval instead of manual+event sync.
- Per-project Drive folders (folder picker instead of fixed "Syzygy").
- Settings surface for the updater channel / release notes display.
- macOS/Linux smoke testing (CI builds them; nobody has run them).
- Code-signing certificate (kills the "Windows protected your PC" interstitial) — cost.
- Re-link UX when Google tokens are revoked server-side.
- Trim `VisionEngine` plumbing if vision is ever dropped (currently kept + used).

## Decision log (the why behind the shape)

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| Fork Aphelion's shell instead of wrapping the Next app | Installer/updater/engine/file-access already proven; no mandatory Penumbra backend fits the product; optional self-hosted collaboration remains possible. |
| Penumbra-original editor | No Tiptap or PolicyPad implementation material enters Syzygy; exact-version MIT Lexical/Yjs packages are the baseline candidate and all product code is authored here. |
| Shared-folder collab before CRDT | A folder is comprehensible, debuggable, and useful alone (docs + knowledge); CRDT rides on top later. |
| Remote-first shared-folder reads + optional mirror | Collaborators avoid mandatory large local copies; explicit sync still supports offline/local workflows. |
| Google creds injected at build time | Public repo + push protection; binaries may carry them (Google: non-confidential for installed apps), plaintext repos shouldn't. |
| New Syzygy signing key (not Aphelion's) | Separate products, separate trust roots; Aphelion's private key wasn't on this machine anyway. |
